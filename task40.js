//40. Album:
//Write a function called make_album() that builds an Object describing a music album. The
//function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing
//these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
//albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
//Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
